# SQL

This was the [Final Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/databases/lessons/sql) in The Odin Project's Databases course. The task was to complete the tutorials and quizes on [sqlzoo.net](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial). This repository contains documents with the answeres for each tutorial and quizz section.

SQL Zoo has the option of two "SQL Engines": 'Microsoft SQL' and 'MySQL'. These quizes were completed with the latter, as per the recomendations of the assignment in the course.

NB: some of the sections had questions where the answer was already given for demonstration of certain concepts. I have included these for completion but noted in the description that the answer was already provided.
